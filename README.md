# â˜• Cafe Delight FAQ Chatbot

This is a simple, FAQ-based chatbot for a fictional cafe called "Cafe Delight." It's built using Streamlit for the user interface and scikit-learn's TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity for natural language processing to match user questions with the best possible answer from a predefined JSON file.

## Features

* **Web-based Chat Interface**: Built with Streamlit, providing a clean and interactive UI.
* **NLP-powered Matching**: Uses TF-IDF vectorization to understand the content of a user's question.
* **Smart Responses**: Employs Cosine Similarity to find the most relevant answer from the FAQ database.
* **Graceful Fallback**: If no question matches with a high-enough similarity (threshold set at 0.3), it provides a "Sorry, I couldn't find an answer" response.
* **Custom Styling**: Includes custom CSS to create a branded, chat-like appearance and hide default Streamlit UI elements.
